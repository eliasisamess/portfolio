# SCALABLE JAVA TIC-TAC-TOE WITH AI

This scalable ASCII Tic-Tac-Toe is the first application I've ever built. It was a project assignment for Introduction to Programming -course. There are some leaks and the app crashes from time to time, but the logics of the AI does work, which I'm pretty proud of as I had never done any coding before starting the school in August 2019. This project was done during Nov-Dec 2019.

## NOTES

<p>- Java package managing might be handled incorrectly.
<p>- AI principles hard to read, as it only uses integers as references. It's all cleared in the comments though.
<p>- I don't intend to update this project, it's just here to remind me of my progress as a developer.
