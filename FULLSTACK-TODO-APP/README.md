# TODO APP

This application was developed during December 2020 together with Lauri Pääjärvi as a full-stack mobile-first school project at Tampere University of Applied Sciences, using JavaScript/ES6+, Node.js and React. The assignment was to implement a RESTful API for a to-do - type of app where a real database is used (MySQL, MongoDB etc) and use the backend application with separate UI implemented with React. I chose the best parts of the app for this code portfolio. The full application can be demoed at Heroku (https://tamk-4a00ez62-3001-group02.herokuapp.com).

You can watch full the demonstration on Youtube: https://youtu.be/7uQEpRlHgP8 

This repository folder does not work as a standalone, since it's missing many parts of the full app. This is just to demonstrate my code writing skills and styles.

Since it is a school project and had a strict deadline, we cannot edit the code within the Heroku app anymore so I have included some notes in the beginning of each file. It's not perfect yet, but it's honest work.

Concerning frontend:

We started to work on the project while still studying React basics and decided early on to use Material UI components instead of building our own ones. At some point we realized we should've probably fully implemented our own components to avoid getting stuck with limitations, obscurities or complexities within the predefined components. I'm looking forward for my next React/UI project to actually have more focus and control over what I'm trying to create.
