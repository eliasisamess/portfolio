# Python-Simple-High-Score-App

School work for a mobile game project.

## Description

<p>This app was made to handle high scores on a mobile game Just Digging (https://19tiko1b.projects.tamk.fi), which was made as a school project work during Spring 2020. I was working as the scrum master for the development team and also implemented this very simple high score application.
 
<p>Includes anonymous files, meaning that I only deleted all username/password info related to the game and uploaded those files for this public repository. I did not update the code itself, so this version dates back to April 19th 2020.
